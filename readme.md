# Project Lucrum Prototype v2

The goal of the second prototype is to make it more stable, scalable and better user experience. The first prototype was built using a MySQL database of which proved troublesome. This version will be built using MongoDB for flexibility. Additionally it is to use a coding framework and use either PHP or Node.js. The design is being completely overhauled based on feedback from our first round of participants.
